rocketboy
=========

The first ever *game* that i've built. It uses the `Java SDK` and the graphics hand-drawn from `GIMP`. This game was inspired by doodle jump, but with a theme from the movie *UP*, pixar's blockbuster.

I am sorry for thebad style, syntax, and general coding practice in this project overal. This game was built while I was in my 1st - 2nd computer science class back in freshman year. It was built because I was sick of all of the file writing IO homework we had, and I wanted something graphical.
