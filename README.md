The first ever "game" that i've programmed. Uses the Java SDK and graphics hand-drawn from GIMP. This game was inspired by doodle jump, but with an 'UP' theme from pixar's blockbuster.

Sorry for the extremely bad style, syntax, and general coding practice in this project overal. This game was in while I was in my 1st - 2nd computer science class back in freshman year, I barely knew what sprites where when this was made.
